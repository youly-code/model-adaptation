    2. Verify Logical Constraints:
       - Total students must equal 30
       - Students in both sports ≤ minimum of individual sports
       - Total students in either sport ≤ sum of individual sports
       - Final answer cannot be negative
    
    3. Visual Verification:
       - Draw a Venn diagram (describe it in text)
       - Verify numbers match across all representations
    
    4. Edge Case Check:
       - What if all numbers were equal?
       - What if there was no overlap?
       - Do these cases reveal any issues in your logic?
       
    5. Critique the challenge of the problem if you think it's stated incorrectly
    
    6. Final Verified Answer:
       - State your conclusion
       - Confirm all constraints are satisfied

# Explanation: Modern self-verification prompting has evolved beyond simple rechecking.
# It now incorporates multiple verification strategies:
# - Breaking down complex problems into verifiable components
# - Using different methods to cross-validate results
# - Applying logical constraints and edge cases
# - Leveraging visual representations for verification
# - Systematic error checking
#
# This technique is particularly effective because it:
# - Reduces errors in complex calculations
# - Helps identify hidden assumptions
# - Provides multiple perspectives on the same problem
# - Forces systematic thinking about edge cases
# - Creates more reliable and trustworthy outputs
#
# It's especially useful in:
# - Mathematical calculations
# - Logical reasoning problems
# - Data analysis tasks
# - Decision-making scenarios
# - Any situation where accuracy is crucial
#
# The key is to structure the verification process so it's not just
# repeating the same calculation, but approaching the problem from
# different angles to ensure robustness of the solution.

    Problem to solve: 
      - 2/5 of the students play soccer
      - half of the students play basketball
      - a quarter of the students play both sports
      - 1/3 of the students play guitar and 2 of them play both sports and guitar
    How many students don't play either sport and play guitar?
    
    Your questions: 
    {join_list(questions)}
    
    My answers to your questions: 
    {join_list(answers)}

    Before solving this problem:
    1. First check if there are any ambiguities, missing information, or inconsistencies in the problem.
    
    2. If you find any issues:
       - Ask ONE clear, specific question to resolve the most critical ambiguity
       - Explain why this clarification is needed
       - Wait for an answer before proceeding further
       
    3. If the problem is completely clear:
       - State that no clarification is needed
       - Proceed with solving the problem step by step

    4. After receiving any clarification:
       - Acknowledge the clarification
       - Check if any other critical ambiguities remain
       - If clear, proceed with the solution
       - If not, ask the next most important question

    Remember: Ask only ONE question at a time, focusing on the most critical issue first.
